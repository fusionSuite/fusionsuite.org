Here is the monthly report for the months of April to July 2024

# I. Introduction

<br>

Performance improvements, backend REST API documentation, security management, End-To-End (e2e) testing, crowdfunding...

A lot of points to cover in this monthly report.

<br>

# II. Project events

<br>

# II.1. Crowdfunding

At the end of August, I will launch a crowdfunding.

The FusionSuite project, as well as the other related ones like FusionInventory, are not going fast enough. Indeed, I am developing in my free time and it is not progressing as fast as I would like.

In order to be able to finalize **FusionSuite 1.0** and **FusionInventory 3.0** as soon as possible, I would like to be full-time on these projects, for 1 full year.

This will allow:

* before the release:
  * finish the development
  * write the documentation
* manage the communication
* release the releases
* after the releases:
  * do the community support
  * define the roadmap
  * manage the corrective versions (there will inevitably be some bugs hanging around)

There will be virtual counterparts, and other physical ones, for people, and even for companies who would participate.

You understood, I need you for this final stretch.

**More information in a dedicated news at the end of August for the launch**

# II.2. Experimentation at our partner DCS EASYWARE

The development version was implemented in June at our partner DCS EASYWARE in order to manage change management.

The solution is performing quite well, there are still features to implement in order to make it even easier to use (yes, it is still in development); almost all of them were already planned ;)

This allows me to have feedback on the use of the tool before the release.

Thanks to [DCS EASYWARE](https://www.dcsit-group.com/) for their trust.

# III. Development

<br>

## III.1. Backend

<br>

### III.1.a Standardization and optimization of item retrieval

There was a problem in the list of property fields (name, default value, can be null/empty, unit...) when retrieving an item or a list of items.

Some fields were not really required and it consumes resources at the database and backend level for nothing.

These fields are therefore standardized (meaning the number has been reduced) and queries are therefore faster.

<br>

### III.1.b Data security

Pentest tools were used to check for possible errors, such as PHP errors, database insertion errors, etc.

I was able to fix the errors highlighted, very few in fact.

These tests are currently being written and will be integrated into the repository; they can be launched occasionally.

XSS tests, in particular, will be carried out in the coming months.

<br>

### III.1.c REST API documentation

The REST API documentation is written in the code and generated by a script with *APIDoc*, but the project maintainer has [announced stopping the project](https://github.com/apidoc/apidoc/issues/1436).

I started to transpose this documentation to the *openapi 3.1* specifications, but they are much less well provided (for example impossible to define if a field is an *integer* or a *number*).

I will see how to get around the problem and provide documentation that is up to date and maintained, I can't stay on *APIDoc*, because soon we will no longer be able to generate this documentation, unless someone takes over the project, I will see that in August and September.

The REST API documentation has already been available for many months [here](https://fusionsuite.org/documentation/restapi/).

<br>

## III.2 Frontend

<br>

### III.2.a Fields

Fields (string, integer, boolean, lists...) continue to be implemented with generic code within the frontend.

End-To-End tests (i.e. simulating operations performed by humans in a browser) are increasingly numerous. These tests have been progressing rather quickly for the past few days.

Many fixes have already been applied to the frontend, but also to the backend.

These tests are written for [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

I hope to finalize them within 1 or 2 months and push all these modifications to the code repository.

# IV. Conclusion

The tool continues to improve, on the way to version 1.0!
