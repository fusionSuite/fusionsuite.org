Here is the monthly report for August 2024

# I. Introduction

<br>

End-To-End (e2e) testing, crowdfunding...

<br>

# II. Project events

<br>

# II.1. Crowdfunding

I spent a lot of time on it, I finalized it on August 31st.

I'm waiting for the validation (a matter of a few days normally) of kickstarter to launch it.

**More information in a dedicated news, in a few days normally, for the launch**

<br>

# II.2. FusionEcosystem Label

The *FusionEcosystem* label was launched this August and I am preparing the modifications at the project level in order to obtain it.

It allows to give more visibility and control to the community on the project.

If you want more information, you can go to the [website](https://fusionecosystem.org).

# III. Development

<br>

## III.1. Backend

<br>

### III.1.a Decimal type properties

With the tests I add at the frontend level, there were several problems that appeared for decimal numbers. Indeed, a value of type `42.0` will actually be `42`, which did not work, because I was filtering to have a comma.

This is now fixed, but not yet pushed to the code repository, I need to add a test for this case.

## III.2 Frontend

<br>

### III.2.a End-2-End tests

The tests continue, we are at 4 types of fields tested out of 15, knowing that for many it will be copy / paste.

This has allowed to highlight several problems on the backend side, but also in the use of these fields.

<br>

# IV. Conclusion

I could not move forward as I wanted, because of 4 days of being sick :/ and the time used for crowdfunding which, if it gives complete satisfaction, will allow to give a boost to the project ;)
