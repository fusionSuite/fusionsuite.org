FusionSuite has been presented to the world the January 12, 2022. It's a software / tool will help to manage your IT service.

After many month of works on the POC, FusionSuite project is born at the end of the POC period (and it's validation).

The website has launched, the [github](https://github.com/fusionSuite/) repositories are now public.

I am (David Durieux) very happy to announce and present this project and to create a community around this free software.

All resources are on the website (directly or with links): development repositories, presentation slides, contact us (discoord server)...

Welcome <strong>FusionSuite!</strong>
